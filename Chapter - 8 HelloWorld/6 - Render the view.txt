You can then render the welcome.blade.php view in your routes or controllers.

For example, in routes/web.php:

// routes/web.php

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('/', function () {
    return view('welcome');
});

Now, when you visit the root URL of your Laravel application, you should see the "Hello, World!" message rendered by the HelloComponent.
