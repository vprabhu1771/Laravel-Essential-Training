In Laravel, components are a way to organize and reuse Blade templates and logic. Below is a simple example of creating a "Hello World" component in Laravel.

Create a new Blade component using the Artisan command-line tool:

php artisan make:component HelloComponent

This will generate a new file at resources/views/components/HelloComponent.blade.php.
