Adding JavaScript (Scripts):

Create a JS file:
    Place your JavaScript files in the public/js directory. For example, you can create a file named scripts.js in the public/js directory.

Include the JS file in your Blade views:
    Open the Blade view file where you want to include the JS file and add the following line just before the closing </body> tag:

<script src="{{ asset('js/scripts.js') }}"></script>


Note:

    The public directory is the public root of your Laravel application, and its contents are directly accessible to the public.

    The asset helper function is used to generate URLs for the assets, taking into account the base URL and versioning if configured.

    Ensure proper file permissions for the directories and files in the public directory to make them accessible.
