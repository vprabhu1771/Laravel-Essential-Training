Adding Images:

Place images in the public directory:
    Store your images in the public/img directory or another appropriate directory within the public folder.

Reference images in your views:
    In your Blade views, use the asset helper function to generate the correct URL for your images. For example:

<img src="{{ asset('img/logo.png') }}" alt="Logo">


Note:

    The public directory is the public root of your Laravel application, and its contents are directly accessible to the public.

    The asset helper function is used to generate URLs for the assets, taking into account the base URL and versioning if configured.

    Ensure proper file permissions for the directories and files in the public directory to make them accessible.
