Before creating your first Laravel project, make sure that your local machine has PHP and Composer installed. 
If you are developing on macOS, PHP and Composer can be installed in minutes via Laravel Herd. 
In addition, we recommend installing Node and NPM.


After you have installed PHP and Composer, you may create a new Laravel project via Composer's create-project command:

composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app


Once the project has been created, start Laravel's local development server using Laravel Artisan's serve command:

cd example-app
 
php artisan serve


Once you have started the Artisan development server, 
your application will be accessible in your web browser at http://localhost:8000. 

Next, you're ready to start taking your next steps into the Laravel ecosystem. 
Of course, you may also want to configure a database.
