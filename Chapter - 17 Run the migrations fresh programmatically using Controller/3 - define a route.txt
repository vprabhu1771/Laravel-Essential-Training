Next, define a route in your routes/web.php file:

use App\Http\Controllers\MigrationFreshController;

Route::get('/migrate-and-seed', [ MigrationFreshController::class, 'migrateAndSeed']);



Now, you can access the route /migrate-and-seed in your browser or through an API client like Postman to trigger the migrations.

Remember to replace 'migrate' with the specific migration command you want to run if you have multiple migration files or commands. 

Also, make sure your web server has the necessary permissions to execute Artisan commands.
