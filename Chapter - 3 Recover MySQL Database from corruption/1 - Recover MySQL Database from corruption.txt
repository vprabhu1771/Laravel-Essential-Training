IMPORTANT: do NOT delete ibdata1 file. You could destroy all your databases.

Instead, first try using the MySQL backup folder which is included with XAMPP. So do next steps:

1) Rename folder mysql/data to mysql/data_old

2) Make a copy of mysql/backup folder and name it as mysql/data

3) Copy all your database folders from mysql/data_old into mysql/data (except mysql, performance_schema, and phpmyadmin folders)

4) Copy mysql/data_old/ibdata1 file into mysql/data folder

5) Start MySQL from XAMPP control panel
