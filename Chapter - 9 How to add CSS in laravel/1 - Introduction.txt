Adding CSS (Stylesheets):

Create a CSS file:
    Place your CSS files in the public/css directory. For example, you can create a file named styles.css in the public/css directory.

Link the CSS file in your Blade views:
    Open the Blade view file where you want to include the CSS file (e.g., resources/views/welcome.blade.php) and add the following line in the <head> section:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ asset('css/styles.css') }}">


Note:

    The public directory is the public root of your Laravel application, and its contents are directly accessible to the public.

    The asset helper function is used to generate URLs for the assets, taking into account the base URL and versioning if configured.

    Ensure proper file permissions for the directories and files in the public directory to make them accessible.
